* 20120824 A significant improvement of this version is the support to EPUB 2.0.x, in which most of the ebooks on the net are published. The SDK API interface is unchanged for compatibility with previous applications. Also we've added Google's AdMob feature. Ebook readers developed by this dev kit will cast advertisements.
